    """
    Search the plant database for a plant by name and return its care information.

    TODO — Milestone 1:

    Right now this always returns a "not found" response. Your job is to implement
    the search logic so it can actually find plants.

    The plant database (_plant_db) is a dict where keys are lowercase slugs like
    "pothos", "snake_plant", "fiddle_leaf_fig". Each plant also has a "display_name"
    field and an "aliases" list with common alternate names.

    Your implementation should handle all three:
      1. Direct key match (e.g., "pothos" → finds "pothos")
      2. Display name match (e.g., "Pothos" → finds "pothos")
      3. Alias match (e.g., "devil's ivy" → finds "pothos")

    All matching should be case-insensitive. Strip whitespace from the input.

    Return format when found:
      {"found": True, "plant": <the full plant dict>}

    Return format when not found:
      {"found": False, "name": <original input>, "message": <helpful string>}

    The message in the not-found case matters — the agent will use it to decide
    what to tell the user. Your spec has a dedicated field for this — think about
    what information would actually be helpful to the agent.

    Before writing code, complete the lookup_plant section of specs/tool-functions-spec.md.
